    "### Testing the Webhook Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the webhook server:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Run the Flask app cell above\n",
    "   # This starts the server on http://localhost:5000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expose your local server with ngrok:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ngrok http 5000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This gives you a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure SendGrid Inbound Parse:**\n",
    "   - Go to SendGrid Dashboard > Settings > Inbound Parse\n",
    "   - Add a new hostname (or use your domain)\n",
    "   - Set POST URL to: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/email`\n",
    "   - Save\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Send a test email:**\n",
    "   - Use `send_email_with_reply_to()` with a reply-to address that matches your inbound parse hostname\n",
    "   - Reply to that email from another account\n",
    "   - Watch the webhook receive and process the reply!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "For production, consider:\n",
    "- Deploying to a cloud service (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Heroku, etc.)\n",
    "- Using a proper task queue (Celery, RQ) for async processing\n",
    "- Adding authentication/verification for webhook requests\n",
    "- Storing conversation history in a database\n",
    "- Adding rate limiting and error handling\n",
    "- Using environment variables for configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add conversation history tracking\n",
    "- Implement multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- Add sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Create different response strategies based on reply type\n",
    "- Integrate with CRM systems\n"

    "## 📧 Setting Up SendGrid Event Webhook (No Domain Needed!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Guide for Gmail Users:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Install ngrok\n",
    "\n",
    "**On macOS:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install ngrok\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Or download from:** https://ngrok.com/download\n",
    "\n",
    "**Or using pip:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyngrok\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Start Your Local Webhook Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the Flask app cell below (Cell 50) to start your webhook server on `http://localhost:5000`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Expose Your Local Server with ngrok\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a **new terminal** and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ngrok http 5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see output like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Forwarding  https://abc123xyz.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copy the HTTPS URL** (e.g., `https://abc123xyz.ngrok-free.app`)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important:** Keep ngrok running in that terminal window!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Configure SendGrid Event Webhook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **SendGrid Dashboard** → **Settings** → **Mail Settings** → **Event Webhook**\n",
    "2. Click **\"Create Webhook\"** or **\"Edit\"** if one exists\n",
    "3. Set **HTTP POST URL** to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/webhook/email`\n",
    "   - Example: `https://abc123xyz.ngrok-free.app/webhook/email`\n",
    "4. **Enable the events you want to track:**\n",
    "   - ✅ **Delivered** - Email was successfully delivered\n",
    "   - ✅ **Opened** - Recipient opened the email\n",
    "   - ✅ **Clicked** - Recipient clicked a link\n",
    "   - ✅ **Bounced** - Email bounced\n",
    "   - ✅ **Dropped** - Email was dropped\n",
    "   - ⚠️ **Note:** For email replies, you'll need Inbound Parse (requires domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click **\"Save\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Test Your Webhook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send a test email using your existing code\n",
    "2. Check your Flask server terminal - you should see webhook events coming in!\n",
    "3. Check SendGrid Dashboard → **Activity** to see events\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What You Can Track with Event Webhooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email Delivery Status** - Know when emails are delivered\n",
    "- **Open Rates** - See who opened your emails\n",
    "- **Click Tracking** - Track which links were clicked\n",
    "- **Bounce Handling** - Handle bounced emails automatically\n",
    "- **Engagement Metrics** - Build analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Limitation: Email Replies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Webhooks cannot receive actual email reply content.** They only send metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To receive actual email replies (for automated responses), you need:**\n",
    "1. A domain (can't use Gmail directly)\n",
    "2. SendGrid Inbound Parse setup\n",
    "3. DNS configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative for testing replies:**\n",
    "- Use a service like **Mailgun** or **Postmark** that offer easier webhook setup\n",
    "- Or get a free domain from services like **Freenom** or **Namecheap** (often $1-2/year)\n"
