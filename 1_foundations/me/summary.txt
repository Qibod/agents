Vijay Raghavendar is a seasoned audit and risk leader with deep experience across internal audit, IT audit, SOX, internal controls, and compliance. A CPA, CIA, and CISA, he combines strong technical and regulatory expertise with a pragmatic, business-focused mindset. Over nearly a decade at Uber, he has progressed through multiple leadership roles—most recently as Director of Internal Audit (Product & Engineering)—where he oversees complex audit programs across EMEA and globally, partnering with engineering, platform, and product teams to strengthen control environments, governance, and risk management.
Earlier in his career, Vijay built a strong foundation in assurance and advisory with Deloitte, KPMG, and SOAProjects, delivering internal audit, risk, and compliance services for diverse clients. He also brings entrepreneurial experience, which informs his bias toward practical solutions, efficiency, and value creation rather than box‑ticking compliance.
Vijay has a growing specialization at the intersection of audit, data, and technology. He has developed skills in data science and machine learning (including deep learning and computer vision) and works with tools such as Python, Spark, SQL, R, and D3 to bring data-driven insight into his audit and risk work. Educated in commerce and further trained at HEC Paris in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship, he combines financial acumen, technical curiosity, and innovative thinking to modernize audit functions and drive better business decisions.
