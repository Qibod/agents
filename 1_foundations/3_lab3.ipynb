A CPA, CIA, and CISA, he combines strong technical and regulatory expertise with a pragmatic, business-focused mindset. Over nearly a decade at Uber, he has progressed through multiple leadership roles—most recently as Director of Internal Audit (Product & Engineering)—where he oversees complex audit programs across EMEA and globally, partnering with engineering, platform, and product teams to strengthen control environments, governance, and risk management.\\nEarlier in his career, Vijay built a strong foundation in assurance and advisory with Deloitte, KPMG, and SOAProjects, delivering internal audit, risk, and compliance services for diverse clients. He also brings entrepreneurial experience, which informs his bias toward practical solutions, efficiency, and value creation rather than box‑ticking compliance.\\nVijay has a growing specialization at the intersection of audit, data, and technology. He has developed skills in data science and machine learning (including deep learning and computer vision) and works with tools such as Python, Spark, SQL, R, and D3 to bring data-driven insight into his audit and risk work. Educated in commerce and further trained at HEC Paris in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship, he combines financial acumen, technical curiosity, and innovative thinking to modernize audit functions and drive better business decisions.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\n+18328154953 (Mobile)\\nvijay0510@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/vijay-\\nr-908ba517 (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nInternal Audit\\nSarbanes-Oxley Act\\nInternal Controls\\nLanguages\\nEnglish (Native or Bilingual)\\nCertifications\\nConvolutional Neural Networks\\nCertified Public Accountant\\nStructuring Machine Learning\\nProjects\\nImproving Deep Neural Networks:\\nHyperparameter tuning,\\nRegularization and Optimization\\nProcess Mining: Data science in\\nAction\\nVijay Raghavendar\\nDirector, Internal Audit\\nAmsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands\\nSummary\\nCPA, CIA, CISA with experience in Internal audit, IT audit, SOX\\nreviews, Big data & analytics, Business process optimization,\\nContract compliance & Project / Team management with an\\nentrepreneurial bend of mind and penchant for lateral thinking.\\nLately, I have taken up a keen interest in Data Science and have\\nlearnt skills around Machine/Deep Learning focused on Computer\\nvision.
